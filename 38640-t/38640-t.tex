%% contents. The book is further divided into 57 logical paragraphs   %%
%% that are printed as bold arabic numerals. Chapter III contains the %%
%% 36 Propositions that make up the restoration of Euclid's work and  %%

Euclid, famed founder of the Alexandrian School of
Mathematics, was the author of not less than nine
works. Approximately complete texts, all carefully edited,
of four of these,
(1)~the \textit{Elements},
(2)~the \textit{Data},
(3)~the \textit{Optics},
(4)~the \textit{Phenomena}, are now our possession.
In the case of
(5)~the \textit{Pseudaria},
(6)~the \textit{Surface-Loci},
(7)~the \textit{Conics}, our
fragmentary knowledge, derived wholly from Greek sources,
makes conjecture as to their content of the vaguest nature.
On~(8) the \textit{Porisms}, Pappus gives extended comment.
As to~(9), the book \textit{On Divisions} (\textit{of figures}), Proclus alone among
Greeks makes explanatory reference.  But in an Arabian
MS., translated by Woepcke into French over sixty years ago,
we have not only the enunciations of all of the propositions
but also the proofs of four of them.

Whilst elaborate restorations of the \textit{Porisms} by Simson
and Chasles have been published, no previous attempt has
been made (the pamphlet of Ofterdinger is not forgotten) to
restore the proofs of the book \textit{On Divisions} (\textit{of figures}). And,
except for a short sketch in Heath's monumental edition of
Euclid's \textit{Elements}, nothing but passing mention of Euclid's
book \textit{On Divisions} has appeared in English.

In this little volume I have attempted:

\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\arabic{enumi})}
\begin{enumerate}
\item to give, with necessary commentary, a restoration of Euclid's
work based on the Woepcke text and on a thirteenth century geometry
of Leonardo Pisano.

\item to take due account of the various questions which arise in
connection with (\textit{a}) certain MSS. of ``Muhammed Bagdedinus,''
(\textit{b}) the Dee-Commandinus book on divisions of figures.

\item to indicate the writers prior to 1500 who have dealt with
propositions of Euclid's work.

% -----File: 011.png---Folio vii------------------------------------------------------
\item to make a selection from the very extensive bibliography of the
subject during the past 400 years.
\end{enumerate}

In the historical survey the MSS. of ``Muhammed Bagdedinus''
play an important rôle, and many recent historians,
for example Heiberg, Cantor, Hankel, Loria, Suter, and
Steinschneider, have contributed to the discussion. As it is
necessary for me to correct errors, major and minor, of all of
these writers, considerable detail has to be given in the first
part of the volume; the brief second part treats of writers on
divisions before 1500; the third part contains the restoration
proper, with its thirty-six propositions. The Appendix deals
with literature since 1500.

A score of the propositions are more or less familiar as
isolated problems of modern English texts, and are also to be
found in many recent English, German and French books
and periodicals. But any approximately accurate restoration
of the work as a whole, in Euclidean manner, can hardly fail
of appeal to anyone interested in elementary geometry or in
Greek mathematics of twenty-two centuries ago.

In the spelling of Arabian names, I have followed Suter.

It is a pleasure to have to acknowledge indebtedness to
the two foremost living authorities on Greek Mathematics.
I refer to Professor J.~L. Heiberg of the University of
Copenhagen and to Sir Thomas~L.\ Heath of London.
Professor Heiberg most kindly sent me the proof pages of
the forthcoming concluding volume of Euclid's \textit{Opera Omnia},
which contained the references to Euclid's book \textit{On Divisions
of Figures}. To Sir Thomas my debt is great. On nearly
every page that follows there is evidence of the influence of
his publications; moreover, he has read this little book in
proof and set me right at several points, more especially in
connection with discussions in Note~113 and Paragraph~50.

divisibility of a figure into others differing from it in kind,
Proclus adds: ``For the circle is divisible into parts unlike
in definition or notion, and so is each of the rectilineal figures;

  It has been stated that Campanus (13.~cent.) did not translate
  Euclid's Elements into Latin, but that the work published as his
  (Venice, 1482---the first printed edition of the \textit{Elements})
  was the translation made about 1120 by the English monk
  Athelhard of Bath. \textit{Cf.} \textsc{Heath},

``After the preface Lord Ussher
[1581--1656], Archbishop of Armagh, has these lines: It is to
be noted that the author uses Euclid's Elements translated
into the Arabic tongue, which Campanus afterwards turned
into Latin. Euclid therefore seems to have been the author
of the Propositions [of \textit{De Divisionibus}] though not of the
demonstrations, which contain references to an Arabic edition
of the Elements, and which are due to Machometus of Bagded
or Babylon.'' This quotation from Smith is reproduced, with
various changes in punctuation and typography, by Kästner\Footnote{16}{   % Footnote 16

Suter inferred that Dee simply made a copy of the above
mentioned MS.\ and that this MS.\ was now in the British
Museum. With his wonted carefulness of statement, Heath
does not commit himself to these views although he admits
their probable accuracy.

\Paragraph{MSS. OF MUHAMMED BAGDEDINUS AND DEE}{4}                        % Paragraph 4
As a final settlement of the question, I propose to
show that Steinschneider and Suter, and hence also many
earlier writers, have not considered all facts available. Some
of their conclusions are therefore untenable. In particular:

(1) In or before 1563 Dee did \emph{not} make a copy of any
Cottonian MS.;

(2) The above mentioned MS.\ (Tiberius, B.\ \textsc{ix}, 6) was
never, in its entirety, in the British Museum;

(3) The inference by Suter that this MS.\ was probably
the Latin translation of the tract from the Arabic, made by
Gherard of Cremona (1114--1187)---among the lists of whose
numerous translations a ``liber divisionum'' occurs---\emph{should
be accepted with great reserve};

(4) The MS.\ which Dee used can be stated with absolute
certainty and this MS.\ did not, in all probability, afterwards
become a Cottonian MS.

(1) Sir Robert Bruce Cotton, the founder of the Cottonian
Library, was born in 1571. The Cottonian Library was not,
therefore, in existence in 1563 and Dee could not then have
copied a Cottonian MS.

(2) The Cottonian Library passed into the care of the
nation shortly after 1700. In 1731 about 200 of the MSS.\
% -----File: 017.png---Folio 5------------------------------------------------------
were damaged or destroyed by fire. As a result of the
parliamentary inquiry Casley reported\Footnote{20}{                       % Footnote 20

on the MSS.\ destroyed
or injured. Concerning Tiberius \textsc{ix}, he wrote, ``This volume
burnt to a crust.'' He gives the title of each tract and the
folios occupied by each in the volume. ``Liber Divisionum
Mahumeti Bag-dadini'' occupied folios 254--258. When the
British Museum was opened in \emph{1753}, what was left of the
Cottonian Library was immediately placed there. Although
portions of all of the leaves of our tract are now to be seen
in the British Museum, practically none of the writing is
decipherable.

  In the British Museum there are three MS.\ catalogues of the
  Cottonian Library:

  (1) \textit{Harleian MS.} 6018, a catalogue made in 1621.
  At the end are memoranda of loaned books.
  On a sheet of paper bearing date Novem.~23, 1638, Tiberius B
  \textsc{ix} is listed (folio~187) with its art.~4:
  ``liber divisione Machumeti Bagdedini.''
  The paper is torn so that the name of the person to whom the work
  was loaned is missing.
  The volume is not mentioned in the main catalogue.

  (2) \textit{MS.~No.}~36789, made after Sir Robert Cotton's death
  in 1631 and before 1638
  (\textit{cf.\ Catalogue of Additions to the MSS.\ in British Museum,
  1900--1905\ldots} London, 1907, pp.~226--227), contains,
  apparently, no reference to ``Muhammed.''

  (3) \textit{MS.~No.}~36682~A, of uncertain date but earlier than
  1654 (\textit{Catalogue of Additions\ldots{}l.c.}\ pp.~188--189).
  On folio 78 \textit{verso} we find Tiberius B \textsc{ix}, Art.\ 4:
  ``Liber divisione Machumeti Bagdedini.''

  A ``Muhammed'' MS.\ was therefore in the Cottonian Library in 1638.

under the editorship of J.~O.~Halliwell. The 95th item
described is a folio parchment volume containing 24 tracts
on mathematics and astronomy. The 17th tract is entitled
``Machumeti Bagdedini liber divisionum.'' As the contents
of this volume are entirely different from those of Tiberius \textsc{ix}
described above, in~(3), it seems probable that there were two
copies of ``Muhammed's'' tract, while the MS.\ which Dee
used for the 1570 publication was undoubtedly his own, as we
shall presently see. If the two copies be granted, there is no
evidence against the Dee copy having been that made by
Gherard of Cremona.

\Paragraph{MSS. OF MUHAMMED BAGDEDINUS AND DEE}{5}                        % Paragraph 5
There is the not remote possibility that the Dee MS.\
was destroyed soon after it was catalogued. For in the same
month that the above catalogue was prepared, Dee left his
home at Mortlake, Surrey, for a lengthy trip in Europe.
Immediately after his departure ``the mob, who execrated
him as a magician, broke into his house and destroyed a great
part of his furniture and books\Footnote{24}{                             % Footnote 24

many of which ``were the

Now the Dee catalogue of his MSS.\
(MS.\ O.\ iv.~20), in Trinity College Library, has numerous
annotations\Footnote{26}{                                                 % Footnote 26

works were (1) destroyed or stolen (``Fr.'')\Footnote{27}{                % Footnote 27

  soldier to indicate that he had survived (\textit{superstes}).
  Whence this abbreviation?}                                              % end footnote 28
after the raid. Opposite the titles of the tracts in the volume
including the tract ``liber divisionum,'' ``Fr.''\ is written, and
opposite the title ``Machumeti Bagdedini liber divisionum''
is the following note: ``Curavi imprimi Urbini in Italia per
Federicum Commandinum exemplari descripto ex vetusto isto
monumento(?) per me ipsum.'' Hence, as stated above, it is
now definitely known (1) that the MS.\ which Dee used was
his own, and (2) that some 20 years after he made a copy, the
MS.\ was stolen and probably destroyed\Footnote{29}{                       % Footnote 29
  The view concerning the theft or destruction of the MS.\ is borne
  out by the fact that in a catalogue of Dee's Library
  (British Museum MS.~35213) made early in the seventeenth century
  (\textit{Catalogue of Additions and Manuscripts}\ldots{}1901,
  p.~211), Machumeti Bagdedini is not mentioned.}.                         % end footnote 29

On the other hand we have the apparently contradictory
% -----File: 019.png---Folio 7------------------------------------------------------
evidence in the passage quoted above (Art.~2) from the life
of Dee by Smith\footnotemark[14]
who was also the compiler of the Catalogue
of the Cottonian Library. Smith was librarian when he
wrote both of these works, so that any definite statement
which he makes concerning the library long in his charge is
not likely to be successfully challenged. Smith does not
however say that Dee's ``Muhammed'' MS.\ was in the
Cottonian Library, and if he knew that such was the case
we should certainly expect some note to that effect in the
catalogue\footnotemark[18];
for in three other places in his catalogue
(Vespasian B \textsc{x}, A \textsc{ii}$_{13}$,
Galba E \textsc{viii}), Dee's original
ownership of MSS.\ which finally came to the Cottonian
Library is carefully remarked. Smith does declare, however,
that the Cottonian MS.\ bore, ``after the preface,'' certain
notes (which I have quoted above) by Archbishop Ussher
(1581--1656). Now it is not a little curious that these notes
by Ussher, who was not born till after the Dee book was
printed, should be practically identical with notes in the
printed work, just after Dee's letter to Commandinus (Art.~3).
For the sake of comparison I quote the notes in question\Footnote{30}{    % Footnote 30
  This quotation from the Leeke-Serle Euclid\footnotemark[11]
  is an exact translation of the original.};                              % end footnote 30
\DPnote{The following quote contains instances of the long-s.}
\label{longs}
``To the Reader.---I am here to advertise thee (kinde Reader)
that this author which we present to thee, made use of Euclid
translated into the Arabick Tongue, whom afterwards Campanus
made to speake Latine. This I thought fit to tell thee, that
so in searching or examining the Propositions which are cited
by him, thou mightest not sometime or other trouble thy selfe
in vain, Farewell.''

The Dee MS.\ as published did not have any preface.
We can therefore only assume that Ussher wrote in a MS.\
which \emph{did} have a preface the few lines which he may have
seen in Dee's printed book.

  understand, that to the very old Copy from whence I writ it,
  the name of \textsc{Machomet Bagdedine} was put in ziphers or
  Characters, (as they call them) who whether he were that
  \textit{Albategnus} whom \textit{Copernicus} often cites as a very
  considerable Author in Astronomie; or that Machomet who is said to
  have been \textit{Alkindus's} scholar, and is reported to have
  written somewhat of the art of Demonstration, I am not yet certain of:
  or rather that this may be deemed a Book of our \textit{Euclide},
  all whose Books were long since turned out of the Greeke into the
  Syriack and Arabick Tongues. Whereupon, It being found some time or
  other to want its Title with the \textit{Arabians} or

  which I am able to prove by many testimonies, to be often done in
  many Moniments of the Ancients;
  \ldots{}yea further, we could not yet perceive so great acuteness of
  any \textit{Machomet} in the Mathematicks, from their moniments
  which we enjoy, as everywhere appears in these Problems.
  Moreover, that \textit{Euclide} also himself wrote one Book
  \ItalicGreekSnippet{peri diair'esewn}
  that is to say, \textit{of Divisions}, as may be evidenced from
  Proclus's Commentaries upon his first of \textit{Elements}:
  and we know none other extant under this title, nor can we find any,
  which for excellencie of its treatment, may more rightfully or
  worthily be ascribed to \textit{Euclid}. Finally, I remember that in
  a certain very ancient piece of Geometry, I have read a place cited
  out of this little Book in expresse words, even as from amost
  (\textit{sic}) certain work of \textit{Euclid}. Therefore we have
  thus briefly declared our opinions for the present, which we desire
  may carry with them so much weight, as they have truth in
  them\ldots. But whatsoever that Book of \textit{Euclid} was
  concerning Divisions, certainly this is such an one as may be both
  very profitable for the studies of many, and also bring much honour
  and renown to every most noble ancient Mathematician; for the most

  discussing of all the Cases in each Probleme\ldots.''}.               % end footnote 35
His arguments
% -----File: 021.png---Folio 9------------------------------------------------------
are summed up, for the most part, in the conclusions of
Heiberg followed by Heath: ``the Arabic original could not
have been a direct translation from Euclid, and probably was
not even a direct adaptation of it; it contains mistakes and
unmathematical expressions, and moreover does not contain
the propositions about the division of a circle alluded to by
Proclus. Hence it can scarcely have contained more than
a fragment of Euclid's work.''

On the other hand Woepcke found in a MS.\ (No.~952.~2
Arab.\ Suppl.)\ of the Bibliothèque nationale, Paris, a treatise
in Arabic on the division of plane figures, which he translated,
and published in 1851\Footnote{36}{                                       % Footnote 36

  Reference to this paper will be made by ``Woepcke.''
  In \textit{Euclidis opera omnia}, vol.~8, now in the press, there are
  ``Fragmenta collegit et disposuit J.~L.\ Heiberg,'' through whose
  great courtesy I have been enabled to see the proof-sheets.
  First among the fragments, on pages
  227--235, are (1) the Proclus references to
  \ItalicGreekSnippet{peri diair'esewn}
and (2) the Woepcke
  translation mentioned above. In the article on Euclid in the last edition of the
  \textit{Encyclopaedia Britannica} no reference is made to this work or to the writings
  of Heiberg, Hultsch, Steinschneider and Suter.}.                        % end footnote 36
``It is expressly attributed to Euclid
in the MS.\ and corresponds to the description of it by Proclus.
Generally speaking, the divisions are divisions into figures of
the same kind as the original figures, e.~g.\ of triangles into
triangles; but there are also divisions into `unlike' figures,
e.~g.\ that of a triangle by a straight line parallel to the base.
The missing propositions about the division of a circle are
also here: `to divide into two equal parts a given figure
bounded by an arc of a circle and two straight lines including
a given angle' and `to draw in a given circle two parallel
straight lines cutting off a certain part of a circle.' Unfortunately
the proofs are given of only four propositions (including the
two last mentioned) out of 36, because the Arabian translator
found them too easy and omitted them.'' That the omission
is due to the translator and did not occur in the original is
indicated in two ways, as Heiberg points out. Five auxiliary
propositions (Woepcke 21, 22, 23, 24, 25) of which no use is
made are introduced. Also Woepcke 5 is: ``\ldots{}and we divide
the triangle by a construction analogous to the preceding
construction''; but no such construction is given.

The four proofs that are given are elegant and depend
% -----File: 022.png---Foilio 10------------------------------------------------------
only on the propositions (or easy deductions from them) of
the \textit{Elements}, while Woepcke~18 has the true Greek ring:
``to apply to a straight line a rectangle equal to the rectangle
contained by $\mathit{AB}$, $\mathit{AC}$ and \emph{deficient by a square}.''

\Paragraph{THE WOEPCKE-EUCLID MS.}{8}                                     % Paragraph 8

To no proposition in the Dee MS.\ is there word for
word correspondence with the propositions of Woepcke but
in content there are several cases of likeness. Thus, Heiberg
continues,
\begin{verse}
  Dee 3 = Woepcke 30 (a special case is Woepcke 1);\\
  Dee 7 = Woepcke 34 (a special case is Woepcke 14);\\
  Dee 9 = Woepcke 36 (a special case is Woepcke 16);\\
  Dee 12 = Woepcke 32 (a special case is Woepcke 4).
\end{verse}

Woepcke~3 is only a special case of Dee~2; Woepcke~6,
7, 8, 9 are easily solved by Dee~8. And it can hardly be
chance that the proofs of exactly these propositions in Dee
should be without fault. That the treatise published by
Woepcke is no fragment but the complete work which was
before the translator is expressly stated\Footnote{37}{                   % Footnote 37
  Woepcke, p.~244.},                                                      % end footnote 37
``fin du traité.'' It
is moreover a well ordered and compact whole. Hence we
may safely conclude that Woepcke's is not only Euclid's own
work but the whole of it, except for proofs of some propositions.

\Paragraph{THE WOEPCKE-EUCLID MS.}{9}                                     % Paragraph 9

Dee, is decidedly misnamed. A more accurate description of
this pamphlet would be, ``A translation of the Dee tract with
indications in notes of a certain correspondence with 15 of

of the enunciations of 16 of the remaining 21 propositions
of Woepcke not previously mentioned.'' Woepcke~30, 31, 34,
35, 36 are not even noticed by Ofterdinger. Hence the claim
I made above (``Introductory'') that the first real restoration
of Euclid's work is now presented. Having introduced
Woepcke's text as one part of the basis of this restoration,
the other part demands the consideration of the

Favaro was the first\footnotemark[6]
to call attention to
the importance of Section IIII\Footnote{41}{                              % Footnote 41

of the \textit{Practica Geometriae} in
connection with the history of Euclid's work. This section
is wholly devoted to the enunciation and proof and numerical
exemplification of propositions concerning the divisions of
figures. Favaro reproduces the enunciations of the propositions
and numbers them 1 to 57\Footnote{42}{                                    % Footnote 42

He points out that in both
enunciation and proof Leonardo 3, 10, 51, 57 are identical
with Woepcke 19, 20, 29, 28 respectively. But considerably
more remains to be remarked.

\Paragraph{PRACTICA GEOMETRIAE OF LEONARDO PISANO}{11}                    % Paragraph 11
No less than twenty-two of Woepcke's propositions
are practically identical in statement with propositions in
Leonardo; the solutions of eight more of Woepcke are either
given or clearly indicated by Leonardo's methods, and all six
of the remaining Woepcke propositions (which are auxiliary)
are assumed as known in the proofs which Leonardo gives of
propositions in Woepcke. Indeed, these two works have
a remarkable similarity. Not only are practically all of the
Woepcke propositions in Leonardo, but the proofs called
for by the order of the propositions and by the auxiliary
propositions in Woepcke are, with a possible single exception\footnotemark[91],
invariably the kind of proofs which Euclid might have given---no
other propositions but those which had gone before or
which were to be found in the \textit{Elements} being required in
the successive constructions.

Leonardo had a wide range of knowledge concerning
Arabian mathematics and the mathematics of antiquity. His
\textit{Practica Geometriae} contains many references to Euclid's
\textit{Elements}
and many uncredited extracts from this work\Footnote{43}{                 % Footnote 43
  For example, on pages 15--16, 38, 95, 100--1, 154.}.                    % end footnote 43
% -----File: 024.png---Folio 12------------------------------------------------------
Similar treatment is accorded works of other writers. But
in the great elegance, finish and rigour of the whole,
originality of treatment is not infrequently evident. If
Gherard of Cremona made a translation of Euclid's book
\textit{On Divisions}, it is not at all impossible that this may have
been used by Leonardo. At any rate the conclusion seems
inevitable that he must have had access to some such MS.\ of
Greek or Arabian origin.

Further evidence that Leonardo's work was of Greek-Arabic
extraction can be found in the fact that, in connection
with the 113 figures, of the section On Divisions, of Leonardo's
work, the lettering in only 58 contains the letters \textit{c} or \textit{f}; that
is, the Greek-Arabic succession \textit{a, b, g, d, e, z \ldots} is used almost
as frequently as the Latin \textit{a, b, c, d, e, f, g,\ldots}; elimination of
Latin letters added to a Greek succession in a figure, for the
purpose of numerical examples (in which the work abounds),
makes the balance equal.

\Paragraph{PRACTICA GEOMETRIAE OF LEONARDO PISANO}{12}                    % Paragraph 12
My method of restoration of Euclid's work has been
as follows. Everything in Woepcke's text (together with
his notes) has been translated literally, reproduced without
change and enclosed by quotation marks. To all of Euclid's
enunciations (unaccompanied by constructions) which corresponded
to enunciations by Leonardo, I have reproduced
Leonardo's constructions and proofs, with the same lettering
of the figures\Footnote{44}{                                              % Footnote 44

but occasional abbreviation in the form of
statement; that is, the extended form of Euclid in Woepcke's
text, which is also employed by Leonardo, has been sometimes
abridged by modern notation or briefer statement. Occasionally
some very obvious steps taken by Leonardo have been left

in square brackets, [\quad]. Unless stated to the contrary, and
indicated by different type, no step is given in a construction
or proof which is not contained in Leonardo. When there
is no correspondence between Woepcke and Leonardo I have
exercised care to reproduce Leonardo's methods in other propositions,
as closely as possible. If, in a given proposition,
the method is extremely obvious on account of what has gone
before, I have sometimes given little more than an indication
of the propositions containing the essence of the required

construction and proof. In the case of the six auxiliary
propositions, the proofs supplied seemed to be readily suggested
by propositions in Euclid's \textit{Elements}.

problems follow the statements of the correspondence with
Leonardo; if exact, a bracket encloses the number of the
Leonardo proposition, according to Favaro's numbering, and
the page and lines of Boncompagni's edition where Leonardo
enunciates the same proposition.

The following is a comparative table of the Euclid and, in

\Section{\textit{Summary}}

It will be instructive, as a means of comparison, to set
forth in synoptic fashion: (1) the Muhammed-Commandinus
treatise; (2) the Euclid treatise; (3) Leonardo's work. In
(1) and (2) I follow Woepcke closely\Footnote{48}{                        % Footnote 48

figure into two parts having a given ratio.
\item The figures divided are: the triangle (props.~1--6);
the parallelogram (11); the trapezium\footnotemark[89]
(8, 12, 13); the quadrilateral
(7, 9, 14--16); the pentagon (17, 18, 22); a pentagon
with two parallel sides (19), a pentagon of which a side is
parallel to a diagonal (20).

\item passes through a given point and is situated:
\begin{enumerate}
\item at a vertex of the proposed figure (1, 7, 17);
\item on any side (2, 9, 18);
\item on one of the two parallel sides (8).
\end{enumerate}

\item is parallel:
\begin{enumerate}
\item to a side (not parallel) (3, 13, 14, 22);
\item to the parallel sides (11, 12, 19);
\item to a diagonal (15, 20);

figure to the opposite side (4);
\item to a transversal which passes through a vertex of the figure (5);
\item to any transversal (6, 16).

\textit{Commandinus's Treatise}---Appended to the first
published edition of Muhammed's work was a short treatise\Footnote{49}{   % Footnote 49

of Muhammed: ``for what things
the author of the book hath at large comprehended in many
problems, I have compendiously comprised and dispatched in
two only.'' This statement repeated by Ofterdinger\Footnote{51}{          % Footnote 51

is somewhat misleading.

The ``two problems'' of Commandinus are as follows:

``Problem I\@. To divide a right lined figure according to
a proportion given, from a point given in any part of the
ambitus or circuit thereof, whether the said point be taken in
any angle or side of the figure.''

``Problem II\@. To divide a right lined figure $\mathit{GABC}$,
% -----File: 027.png---Folio 15------------------------------------------------------
according to a proportion given, $E$ to $F$, by a right line
parallel to another given line $D$.''

But the first problem is divided into 18 cases: 4 for the
triangle, 6 for the quadrilateral, 4 for the pentagon, 2 for the
hexagon and 2 for the heptagon; and the second problem, as
Commandinus treats it, has 20 cases: 3 for the triangle, 7 for
the quadrilateral, 4 for the pentagon, 4 for the hexagon, 2 for
the heptagon.

\item Auxiliary Propositions:

Although not explicitly stated or proved, Leonardo makes
use of four out of six of Euclid's auxiliary propositions\footnotemark[113].
On the other hand he proves two other propositions which Favaro
does not number: (1) Triangles with one angle of the one
equal to one angle of the other, are to one another as the
rectangle formed by the sides about the one angle is to that
formed by the sides about the equal angle in the other;
(2) the medians of a triangle meet in a point and trisect one
another.

of Savasorda and his \textit{Liber embadorum} known through
the Latin translation of Plato of Tivoli. Abraham was a
learned Jew of Barcelona who probably employed Plato of
Tivoli to make the translation of his work from the Hebrew.
This translation, completed in 1116, was published by Curtze,
from fifteenth century MSS., in 1902\Footnote{54}{                        % Footnote 54

Pages 130--159 of this
edition contain ``capitulum tertium in arearum divisionum
explanatione'' with Latin and German text, and among the
many other propositions given by Savasorda is that of
Proclus-Euclid (= Woepcke 28 = Leonardo 57). Compared
with Leonardo's treatment of divisions Savasorda's seems
rather trivial. But however great Leonardo's obligations to
other writers, his originality and power sufficed to make
a comprehensive and unified treatise.

Almost contemporary with Leonardo was Jordanus Nemorarius
(d.~1237) who was the author of several works, all
probably written before 1222.

devoted to problems on divisions: Propositions 1--7 to the
division of lines and Propositions 8, 13, 17, 18, 19 to the
division of rectilineal figures. The enunciations of Propositions
8, 13, 17, 19 correspond, respectively, to Euclid 3, 26, 19, 14
and to Leonardo 2, 4, 3, 36. But Jordanus's proofs are quite
differently stated from those of Euclid or Leonardo. Both
for themselves and for comparison with the Euclidean proofs
which have come down to us, it will be interesting to reproduce
propositions 13 and 17 of Jordanus.

``Let $\mathit{abc}$ be the triangle and $d$ the point outside but
contained within the lines $\mathit{aef, hbl}$, which are lines dividing
the triangle equally and produced. For if $d$ be taken in any
such place, draw $\mathit{dg}$ parallel to $\mathit{ca}$ meeting $\mathit{cb}$ produced in $g$.
Join $\mathit{cd}$ and find $\mathit{mn}$ such that

Then divide $\mathit{cg}$ in $k$ such that
\[\mathit{gk:kc}=\mathit{kc:mn}.   \]
Produce $\mathit{dk}$ to meet $\mathit{ca}$ in $p$. Then I say that $\mathit{dp}$ divides the
triangle $\mathit{abc}$ into equal parts.

For, since the triangle $\mathit{ckp}$ is similar to the triangle $\mathit{kdg}$,
by 4 of sixth\Footnote{56}{                                               % Footnote 56

and parallel lines and 15 of first and definitions
of similar areas,
\[

  I do not know the MS.\ of Euclid here referred to; but manifestly it is the
  Porism of \textit{Elements} \textsc{vi}.~19 which is quoted:
  ``If three straight lines be proportional,
  then as the first is to the third, so is the figure described on the first to that
  which is similar and similarly described on the second.''}.             % end footnote 57
But
\[
\triangle\mathit{kdg}:\triangle\mathit{cdg}=\mathit{kg:cg}.

Therefore, by equal proportions,
\begin{DPalign*}
            \triangle\mathit{ckp}&:\triangle\mathit{cdg}=\mathit{mn:cg}.  \\
 \therefore \triangle\mathit{ckp}&:\triangle\mathit{cdg}=

\noindent
And by the same process of deduction we may be led to
an absurdity, namely, that all may equal a part if the point $k$
be otherwise than between $e$ and $b$ or the point $p$ be otherwise
than between $h$ and $a$; the part cut off must always be either
all or part of the triangle $\mathit{aec}$.''

and it is stated in the form of a problem
on divisions. In Leonardo this problem is treated\footnotemark[109]
by showing that the medians of a triangle are concurrent; but
in Jordanus (as in Heron\footnotemark[83])
the question discussed is, ``to find a
point in a triangle such that when it is joined to the angular
points, the triangle will be divided into three equal parts''(p.~18).

A much later work, \textit{Summa de Arithmetica Geometria
Proportioni et Proportionalita\ldots} by Luca Paciuolo (b.~about
1445) was published at Venice in 1494\Footnote{61}{                       % Footnote 61

In the geometrical
section (the second, and separately paged) of the work,
pages 35 \textit{verso}--43 \textit{verso}, problems on divisions of figures are
solved, and in this connection the author acknowledges great
debt to Leonardo's work. Although the treatment is not as

full as Leonardo's, yet practically the same figures are employed.
The Proclus-Euclid propositions which have to do
with the division of a circle are to be found here.

Abû Mu\d{h}ammed b.\ `Abdelbâqî el-Ba\.{g}dâdî

an excellent commentary on Book \textsc{x} of the \textit{Elements}
has been ascribed. Of a MS.\ by this author Gherard of Cremona
(1114--1187) may well have been a translator.

Euclid's book \textit{On Divisions} was undoubtedly the ultimate
basis of all Arabian works on the same subject. We have
record of two or three other treatises.

1. \b{T}âbit b.\ Qorra (826--901) translated parts of the works
of Archimedes and Apollonius, revised Ishâq's translation of
Euclid's \textit{Elements} and \textit{Data} and also revised the work
\textit{On Divisions of Figures} translated by an anonymous
writer\Footnote{76}{                                                      % Footnote 76

2. Abû Mu\d{h}.\ el-Hasan b.\ `Obeidallâh b.\ Soleimân b.\
Wahb (d.~901) was a distinguished geometer who wrote
``A Commentary on the difficult parts of the work of Euclid''
and ``The Book on Proportion.'' Suter thinks\Footnote{77}{                % Footnote 77

  ``Die Mathematiker\ldots,'' pp.\ 48 and 211, note 23.}                  % end footnote 77
that another
reading is possible in connection with the second title, and
that it may refer to Euclid's work \textit{On Divisions}.

3. Abû'l Wefâ el-Bûz\v{g}ânî (940--997) one of the greatest
of Arabian mathematicians and astronomers spent his later
life in Bagdad, and is the author of a course of Lectures on
geometrical constructions. Chapters \textsc{vii--ix} of the Persian
form of this treatise which has come down to us in roundabout
fashion were entitled: ``On the division of triangles,'' ``On
the division of quadrilaterals,'' ``On the division of circles''
respectively. Chapter \textsc{vii} and the beginning of Chapter \textsc{viii}
are, however, missing from the Bibliothèque nationale Persian
MS.\ which has been described by Woepcke\Footnote{78}{                    % Footnote 78

from an Arabian text, by one Abû Ishâq b.\ `Abdallâh with

the assistance of four pupils and the aid of another translation.
The Arabian text was an abridgment of Abû'l Wefâ's lectures
prepared by a gifted disciple.

The three propositions of Chapter \textsc{ix}\Footnote{79}{               % Footnote 79

there are 24 propositions. About a score are given, in substance,
by both Leonardo and Euclid.

In conclusion, it may be remarked that in Chapter \textsc{xii}
of Abû'l Wefâ's work are 9 propositions, with various solutions,
for dividing the surface of a sphere into equiangular and
equilateral triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons and hexagons.

On Divisions of Figures;

of the problems of Euclid's book \textit{On Divisions} among Arabians,
as well as later in Europe, was no doubt largely due to the
possible practical application of the problems in the division
of parcels of land of various shapes, the areas of which,
according to the Rhind papyrus, were already discussed in
empirical fashion about 1800 \textsc{b.~c.} In the first century before
Christ\Footnote{81}{                                                      % Footnote 81

division of surfaces and solids in the third book of his

Although the enunciations of the
propositions in this book are, as a whole, similar\Footnote{83}{          % Footnote 83
  Only two are exactly the same:
  \textsc{ii--iii} (= Euclid~30), \textsc{vii} (= Euclid~32),
  the problem considered in \textsc{x} is practically Euclid~27 (Art.~48),
  while \textsc{xviii} is closely
  related to Euclid~29 (Art.~50).
  In \textsc{xix} Heron finds in a triangle a point such that
  when it is joined to the angular points, the triangle will be
  divided into three equal parts. The divisions of solids of which
  Heron treats are of a sphere (\textsc{xxiii}) and the division in a
  given ratio, by a plane parallel to the base, of a Pyramid
  (\textsc{xx}) and of a Cone (\textsc{xxi}).
  For proof of Proposition \textsc{xxiii}:
  \textit{To cut a sphere by a plane so that the volumes of the segments
  are to one another in a given ratio}, Heron refers to Proposition~4,
  Book~\textsc{ii} of ``On the Sphere and Cylinder'' of Archimedes; the
  third proposition in the same book of the Archimedean work is
  (Heron~\textsc{xvii}):
  \textit{To cut a given sphere by a plane so that the surfaces
  of the segments may have to one another a given ratio}.

to those
% -----File: 039.png---Folio 27------------------------------------------------------
in Euclid's book \textit{On Divisions}, Heron's discussion consists
almost entirely of ``analyses'' and approximations. For
example, \textsc{ii}: ``To divide a triangle in a given ratio by a
line drawn parallel to the base''---while Euclid gives the
general construction, Heron considers that the sides of the
given triangle have certain known numerical lengths and
thence finds the approximate
distance of the angular points of
the triangle to the points in the sides where the
required line
parallel to the base intersects them, because, as he expressly
states, in a field with uneven surface it is difficult to draw a
line parallel to another.
Most of the problems are discussed
with a variety of numbers although theoretical analysis sometimes
enters.
Take as an example Proposition \textsc{x}\Footnote{84}{                   % Footnote 84

``Suppose the construction made. Then the ratio of triangle
$\mathit{AEZ}$ to quadrilateral $\mathit{ZEB\Gamma}$ is known;
also the ratio of the triangle $\mathit{AB\Gamma}$ to
the triangle $\mathit{AZE}$. But the triangle
$\mathit{AB\Gamma}$ is known, therefore so is the
triangle $\mathit{AZE}$. Now $\Delta$ is given.
Through a known point $\Delta$ there is
therefore drawn a line which, with two
lines $\mathit{AB}$ and $\mathit{A\Gamma}$ intersecting in $A$,
encloses a known area.

Therefore the points $E$ and $Z$ are
given. This is shown in the second
book of \textit{On Cutting off a Space}. Hence the required proof.

If the point $\Delta$ be not on $\mathit{B\Gamma}$ but anywhere this will make
no difference.''

the author of the above-mentioned work is not given by
Heron, the reference is clearly to Apollonius's lost work.
According to Pappus it consisted of two books which contained
124 propositions treating of the various cases of the
% -----File: 040.png---Folio 28------------------------------------------------------
following problem: \textit{Given two coplanar straight lines
$\mathit{A_1P_1,B_2P_2}$, on which $A_1$ and $B_2$ are fixed points; it is required to
draw through a fixed point $\Delta$ of the plane, a transversal $\mathit{\Delta ZE}$
forming on $\mathit{A_1P_1, B_2P_2}$ the two segments $\mathit{A_1Z, B_2E}$ such that
$\mathit{A_1Z}\centerdot\mathit{B_2E}$ is equal to a given rectangle.}

Given a construction for the particular case when
$\mathit{A_1P_1,B_2P_2}$ meet in $A$,
and when $A_1$ and $B_2$ coincide with $A$---Heron's
reasoning becomes clear. The solution of this particular
case is practically equivalent to the solution of Euclid's
Proposition 19 or 20 or 26 or 27. References to restorations
of Apollonius's work are given in note 111.

of Euclid's
problems here under discussion,
I should not fail to mention the
last of the 38 lemmas which
Pappus gives as useful in connection
with the 171 theorems
of Euclid's lost book of
\textit{Porisms:
Through a given point $E$ in $\mathit{BD}$
produced to draw a line cutting
the parallelogram $\mathit{AD}$ such that
the triangle $\mathit{Z\Gamma H}$ is equal to the parallelogram $\mathit{AD}$.}

After ``Analysis'' Pappus has the following

``Synthesis. Given the parallelogram $\mathit{AD}$ and the point $E$. Through $E$
draw the line $\mathit{EZ}$ such that the
rectangle $\mathit{\Gamma Z\centerdot \Gamma H}$ equals twice the
rectangle $\mathit{A\Gamma\centerdot \Gamma D}$. Then
according to the above analysis [which contains a reference
to an earlier lemma discussed a little later\footnotemark[88]
in this book] the
triangle $\mathit{Z\Gamma H}$ equals the parallelogram $\mathit{AD}$. Hence $\mathit{EZ}$
satisfies the problem and is the only line to do so\Footnote{85}{         % Footnote 85

  this lemma is used in connection with ``Porism \textsc{clxxx}:

  points $I$ and $J'$ can be found in
  a line with $P$ and such that if one take on $\mathit{SA}$,
  $\mathit{SA'}$ two points $m$, $m'$, bound by the

  \textit{Et si á trigono
  recta protracta fuerit secans duo latera trigonj, que cum ipsis
  duobus lateribus faciant trigonum habentem angulum unum comunem cum
  ipso trigono, erit proportio unius trigoni ad alium, sicut facta ex
  lateribus continentibus ipsum angulum}. This is followed by the
  sentence ``Ad cuius rei euidentiam.'' Then come the construction and
  proof:

  Let $\mathit{abc}$ be the given triangle and $\mathit{de}$ the line
  across it, meeting the sides $\mathit{ca}$ and $\mathit{cb}$ in the points
  $d$, $e$, respectively. I say that
  \[
    \triangle\mathit{abc}:\triangle\mathit{dec} =
       \mathit{ac}\centerdot\mathit{cb:dc}\centerdot\mathit{ce}.
  \]

  \textit{Proof:}
  To $\mathit{ac}$ apply the triangle $\mathit{afc}= \triangle\mathit{dec}$. [\textsc{i}.~44]

  Since the triangles $\mathit{abc, afc}$ are of the same altitude,
  \begin{flalign*}
    && \mathit{bc} &: \mathit{fc} = \triangle\mathit{abc} : \triangle\mathit{afc}.
    &&\text{ [\textsc{vi}.~1]\quad}\\

    &\text{and since } \triangle\mathit{dec} = \triangle\mathit{acf},&&&&\\
    && \triangle\mathit{acb} &: \triangle\mathit{dce} =
        \mathit{ac}\centerdot\mathit{bc}:\mathit{ac}\centerdot\mathit{cf}. &&
  \end{flalign*}

  Again, since the triangles $\mathit{acf, dce}$ are equal and have a common angle, as in
  the fifteenth theorem of the sixth book of Euclid, the sides are mutually proportional.
  \begin{gather*}
    \therefore \mathit{ac:dc}=\mathit{ce:cf},\qquad
    \therefore \mathit{ac}\centerdot\mathit{cf}=\mathit{dc}\centerdot\mathit{ce},\\
    \therefore \triangle\mathit{acb}:\triangle\mathit{dce} =
                \mathit{ac}\centerdot\mathit{cb}:\mathit{dc}\centerdot\mathit{ce}.\\
  \end{gather*}
  \hfill ``quod oportebat ostendere.''\qquad

  It is to be observed that the Latin letters are used with the above figure.
  This suggests the possibility of the proof being due to Leonardo.

  The theorem is assumed in Euclid's proof of proposition~19 (Art.~40)
  and it occurs, directly or indirectly, in more than one of his
  works. A proof, depending on the proposition that the area of a
  triangle is equal to one-half the product of its base and altitude,
  is given by Pappus (pp.~894--897) in connection with one of his
  lemmas for Euclid's book of \textit{Porisms}: \textit{Triangles
  which have one angle of the one equal or supplementary to one angle
  of the other are in the ratio compounded of the
% -----File: 044.png---Folio 32------------------------------------------------------
  ratios of the sides about the equal or supplementary angles}.

  \textit{Opera quaedam reliqua\ldots} 1776,
  p.~515 ff.---\textsc{P.~Breton} (de Champ),

  \textit{Les trois livres de Porismes d'Euclide\ldots}

  The first part of this lemma is practically equivalent to either
  (1) [\textsc{vi}.~23]:
  \textit{Equiangular parallelograms have to one another the ratio
  compounded of the ratio of their sides};
  or (2) the first part of Prop.~70 of the \textit{Data}
  (\textit{Euclidis Data\ldots} edidit H.~Menge, Lipsiae, 1896, p.~130f.):
  \textit{If in two equiangular parallelograms the sides
  containing the equal angles have a given ratio to one another}
  [i.~e.\ one side in one to one side in the other],
  \textit{the parallelograms themselves will also have a given ratio to
  one another.} \textit{Cf.}\ \textsc{Heath}, \textit{Thirteen Books of
  Euclid's Elements}, \textsc{ii}, 250.

  The proposition is stated in another way by Pappus\footnotemark[85]
  (p.~928) who proves that
  \textit{a parallelogram is to an equiangular parallelogram as the
  rectangle contained by the adjacent sides of the first is to the
  rectangle contained by the adjacent sides of the second.}

  The above theorem of Leonardo is precisely the first of those
  theorems which Commandinus adds to \textsc{vi}.~17 of \emph{his}
  edition of Euclid's \textit{Elements} and concerning which he writes

Let $\mathit{abg}$ be the given triangle with base $\mathit{bg}$.
Produce $\mathit{ba}$
to $d$ till $\mathit{ba} = 3\mathit{ad}$, and produce $\mathit{ad}$ to
$e$ till $\mathit{ad}=\mathit{de}$; then $ae = \frac{2}{3} ba$. Find
$\mathit{az}$, a mean proportional between $\mathit{ba}$
and $\mathit{ad}$, and $\mathit{ia}$ a mean proportional
between $\mathit{ba}$ and $\mathit{ae}$. Then through
$z$ and $i$ draw $\mathit{zt}$, $\mathit{ik}$ parallel to $\mathit{bg}$
and I say that the triangle $\mathit{abg}$ is
divided into three equal parts of
which one is the triangle $\mathit{azt}$, another
the quadrilateral $\mathit{zikt}$, the third
the quadrilateral $\mathit{ibgk}$.

\textit{Proof:} Since
\begin{gather*}
  \mathit{ba:az} = \mathit{az:ad},  \\
  \mathit{ba:ad} = \triangle\mathit{abg}:\triangle\mathit{azt}, \tag*{[\textsc{vi}.~19, Porism]}
\end{gather*}
for these triangles are similar.

\begin{DPalign*}
\lintertext{\indent Now }  ba = 3ad; \quad\therefore &\triangle\mathit{abg} =

  \therefore\triangle\mathit{azt} &= \tfrac{1}{3}\triangle\mathit{abg}. &&  \\
\lintertext{\indent Again,}  ba:ia &= ia:ae;
\end{DPalign*}
$\therefore ba: ae = \triangle$ on $\mathit{ea}$: similar and similarly situated $\triangle$ on $\mathit{ai}$.

But triangles $\mathit{aik, abg}$ are similar and similarly described
on $\mathit{ai}$ and $\mathit{ab}$; and
\begin{align*}
\mathit{ea:ab} &= 2: 3.  \\
  \therefore\triangle\mathit{aik} &= \tfrac{2}{3}\triangle\mathit{abg}.
\end{align*}

And since $\triangle\mathit{azt} = \tfrac{1}{3}\triangle\mathit{abg}$, there remains the quadrilateral
$\mathit{zikt} = \tfrac{1}{3} \triangle\mathit{abg}$.
We see that the quadrilateral $\mathit{ibgk}$ will be the
other third part; hence the triangle $\mathit{abg}$ has been divided into
three equal parts; ``quod oportebat facere.''

Given the triangle $\mathit{bgd}$; if $a$
be the middle point of $\mathit{gd}$ the line
$\mathit{ba}$ will divide the triangle as required;
either because the triangles
are on equal bases and of
the same altitude [\textsc{i}.~38; Leonardo
1], or because
\begin{flalign*}
  && \triangle\mathit{bgd}: \triangle\mathit{bad}
&= \mathit{bd}\centerdot\mathit{dg}: \mathit{bd}\centerdot\mathit{da}\footnotemark[88].\qquad  &&\\
\text{\indent Whence } && \triangle\mathit{bgd} &= 2\triangle\mathit{bad}. &&
\end{flalign*}

% -----File: 046.png---Folio 34------------------------------------------------------

But if the given point be not the middle point of any side,
let $\mathit{abg}$ be the triangle and
$d$ the given point nearer to $b$
than to $g$. Bisect $\mathit{bg}$ at $e$ and
draw $\mathit{ad,ae}$.
Through $e$ draw $\mathit{ez}$ parallel to $\mathit{da}$; join $\mathit{dz}$.
Then the triangle $\mathit{abg}$ is bisected by $\mathit{dz}$.

\textit{Proof:} Since
\[
\mathit{ad}\parallel\mathit{ez},\quad \triangle\mathit{adz} = \triangle\mathit{ade}.
\]

To each add $\triangle\mathit{abd}$. Then
\begin{DPalign*}
 \text{quadl.}\mathit{abdz}      &=
    \triangle\mathit{abd} + \triangle\mathit{ade},  \\
                                  &= \triangle\mathit{abe}.    \\

 \therefore\, \text{quadl.}\mathit{abdz} &= \tfrac{1}{2} \triangle\mathit{abg};
\end{DPalign*}
and the triangle $\mathit{zdg}$ is the other half of the triangle $\mathit{abg}$.
Therefore the triangle $\mathit{abg}$ is divided into two equal parts by
the line $\mathit{dz}$ drawn from the point $d$;

  It is to be noticed that Leonardo's discussion of this proposition
  is hardly ``analogous to the preceding construction'' which is
  certainly simpler than if it had been similar to that of Prop.~5.
  A construction for Prop.~4 along the same lines,

  Let $\mathit{zti}$ be a line such that
  \[

  Divide $\mathit{tz}$ into two equal parts, $\mathit{tk,kz}$. Find $m$ such that

    em^2:eb^2 = ki:zi.

  Then $m$ leads to the same solution as before. [For, in brief,
  \begin{align*}
    em^2 &= eb^2\left(\frac{ki}{zi}\right)
      = eb^2\left(\frac{\frac{zt}{2} + ti}{zi}\right)

The construction in this proposition is limited to the case where ``a certain
fraction'' is the reciprocal of an integer. But more generally, if the fraction
were $\mathit{m:n}$ (the ratio of the lengths of two given lines),
we could proceed in a
very similar way: Divide $\mathit{ad}$ in $e$, internally,
so that $\mathit{ae : ed = m:n-m \quad (n > m)}$.
In $\mathit{ad}$ cut off $\mathit{ef}=\mathit{ae}$ and
through $f$ draw $\mathit{fh}$ parallel to $\mathit{ab}$.
Then, as before, the problem is reduced to Proposition~6.

If the point $e$ should fall at $i$ or in the interval $\mathit{ai}$ the
part cut off from the
parallelogram by the required line would be in the form of a triangle which
might be determined by \textsc{i}.~44.

Let $\mathit{ad}$ be the shorter of the parallel sides $\mathit{ad, bg}$, which
are bisected in $t$ and $k$ respectively. Join $\mathit{tk}$. Then if $\mathit{bt,gt}$
be joined, [it is clear, from triangles on equal bases and
between the same parallels, that $\mathit{tk}$ bisects the trapezium].

\SmallLeftNote{Next consider the given point as any point on the shorter side}
[Leonardo~25, p.~127, ll.~2--3].

First let the point be at the angle $a$. Cut off $\mathit{kl}$ in $\mathit{kg}$,
equal to $\mathit{at}$.
Join $\mathit{al}$, meeting $\mathit{tk}$ in $m$; then the quadrilateral
is divided as required by $\mathit{al}$. For [the triangles $\mathit{atm, mkl}$ are
equal in all respects, etc.].

which is proved as in the preceding case.

other end of the bisecting line would be between $k$ and $l$.

point would be between $k$ and $n$.]

\SmallLeftNote{Although not observed by Favaro, Leonardo now considers:}

If the given point be in the side $\mathit{bg}$; either $l$, or $n$, or a
point between $l$ and $n$, then the above construction is at once
applicable.

Suppose, however, that the given point were at $b$ or in
the segment $\mathit{bn}$, at $g$ or in the segment $\mathit{lg}$.
First consider the given point at $b$.
Join $\mathit{bd}$ and through $n$ draw $\mathit{nc}$ parallel
to $\mathit{bd}$ to meet $\mathit{gd}$ in $c$. Join $\mathit{bc}$.
Then $\mathit{bc}$ bisects the trapezium.
For [$\mathit{abnd}$ is half of the trapezium $\mathit{ag}$, and the triangle $\mathit{bnd}$
equals the triangle $\mathit{bdc}$ etc.].

Similarly from a given point between $b$ and $n$, a line could
be drawn meeting $\mathit{gd}$ between $c$ and $d$, and dividing the
quadrilateral into two equal parts.

So also from $g$ a line $\mathit{gf}$ could be drawn [etc.]; and
similarly for a given point between $g$ and $l$.

\SmallLeftNote{Leonardo then concludes (p.~127, ll.~37--40):}

``Jam ostensum est quomodo in duo equa quadrilatera

\small
This proposition is not explicitly formulated by Leonardo; but the general
method he would have employed seems obvious from what has gone before.

Suppose it were required to cut off one-third of the given parallelogram $\mathit{ac}$
by a line drawn through a point $e$ outside of the parallelogram. Then by the
method of Proposition 7, form a parallelogram two-thirds of $\mathit{ac}$. There are four
such parallelograms with centres $g_1, g_2, g_3, g_4$. Lines $l_1, l_2, l_3, l_4$ through
each one of these points and $e$ will bisect a parallelogram (Proposition 10).

There are several cases to consider with regard to the position of $e$ but it
may be readily shown that, in one case at least, there is a line $l_i(i=1, 2, 3, 4)$,
which will cut off a third of the parallelogram $\mathit{ac}$.

Similarly for one-fourth, one-fifth, or any other fraction such as $\mathit{m:n}$ which
represents the ratio of lengths of given lines.

  are the same. I have given a literal translation in Proposition~12.
  Heath's translation and interpretation (after Woepcke) are given in 13.
  Concerning 12 and 13 Woepcke adds the following note:
  ``Suppose it were required to cut off the $n$th part of the
  trapezium $\mathit{ABDC}$; make $\mathit{A\alpha}$ and
  $\mathit{C\gamma}$ respectively equal
  to the $n$th parts of $\mathit{AB}$ and of $\mathit{CD}$;
  then $\mathit{A\alpha\gamma C}$ will be the $n$th part of the trapezium,
  for $\mathit{\gamma\alpha}$ produced
  will pass through the intersection of $\mathit{CA}$, $\mathit{DB}$ produced.
  Now to draw through a given point $E$ the transversal which cuts off
  a certain fraction of the trapezium, join the middle point $\mu$ of
  the segment $\mathit{\alpha\gamma}$, and the point $E$, by a line;
  this line $\mathit{EFG}$ will be the transversal required to be drawn,
  since the triangle $\mathit{\alpha F\mu}$
  equals the triangle $\mathit{\gamma G\mu}$.

  ``But when the given point is situated as $E'$ or $E''$ such
  that the transversal drawn through $\mu$ no longer meets the two
  parallel sides but one of the parallel sides and one of the two
  other sides, or the other two sides; then the construction indicated
  is not valid since $\mathit{CG'\mu\gamma}$ is not equal to $\mathit{BF'\mu\alpha}$.
  It appears that this is the idea which the text is intended to express.
  The `points of concourse' are the vertices where a parallel side
  and one of the two other sides intersect; and the expression
  `beyond' refers to the movement of the transversal represented as

\SmallLeftNote{We first take up Leonardo's discussion of Proposition 12.}

In the figure of Proposition 8, suppose $\mathit{al}$ to be produced
in the directions of the points $e$ and $r$;
$\mathit{tk}$ in the directions of $q$ and $v$,
$\mathit{dn}$ of $z$ and $h$,
$\mathit{cb}$ of $i$ and $o$,
$\mathit{gf}$ of $s$ and $p$.
Then for [any such exterior points
$e$, $q$, $z$, $i$, $s$, $r$, $v$, $h$, $o$, $p$,
lines are drawn bisecting the trapezium].

If the given point, $x$, were anywhere in the section of the
plane above $\mathit{ad}$ and between $\mathit{ea}$ and $\mathit{dz}$,
the line joining $x$ to $m$ would [by the same reasoning as in Proposition~8]
bisect the trapezium. Similarly for all points below $\mathit{nl}$ and between
% -----File: 057.png---Folio 45------------------------------------------------------
$\mathit{hn}$ and $\mathit{lr}$
[\ldots\ldots so also for all points within the triangles $\mathit{amd, nml}$].

\small
This seems to be all that Euclid's Proposition 12 calls for. But just as
Leonardo considers Proposition 8 for the general case with the given point
anywhere on the perimeter of the trapezium, so here, he discusses the constructions
for drawing a line from any point inside or outside of a trapezium
to divide it into two equal parts.

Leonardo does not give any details of the discussion of Euclid's Proposition
13, but after presentation of the cases given in Proposition 9
concludes:

dato super aliquod laterum ipsius, et etiam ab omni puncto
dato infra uel extra''
\small
[Leonardo 32, p.~134, ll.~10--12].

From Leonardo's discussion in Propositions 8, 9, 12, not only are the
necessary steps for the construction of 13 (indicated in the Woepcke note
above\footnotemark[101])
evident, but also those for the more general cases, not considered
by Euclid, where restrictions are not imposed on the position of the given
point.

equal parts by a straight line drawn from a given vertex of the

Let $\mathit{abcd}$ be the quadrilateral and $a$ the given vertex.
Draw the diagonal $\mathit{bd}$, meeting the diagonal $\mathit{ac}$ in $e$.
If $\mathit{be}$, $\mathit{ed}$
are equal, [$\mathit{ac}$ divides the quadrilateral as required].

If $\mathit{be}$ be not equal to $\mathit{ed}$,
make $\mathit{bz} = \mathit{zd}$.

Draw $\mathit{zi}\parallel\mathit{ac}$ to meet $\mathit{dc}$ in $i$.
Join $\mathit{ai}$. Then the quadrilateral
$\mathit{abcd}$ is divided as required by the line $\mathit{ai}$.

\emph{Proof}: Join $\mathit{az}$ and $\mathit{zc}$. Then the triangles $\mathit{abz, azd}$ are
respectively equal to the triangles $\mathit{cbz, cdz}$.

% -----File: 058.png---Folio 46------------------------------------------------------

Therefore the quadrilateral $\mathit{abcz}$ is one-half the quadrilateral $\mathit{abcd}$.

And since the triangles $\mathit{azc,aic}$ are on the same base and
between the same parallels $\mathit{ac,zi}$, they are equal.

To each add the triangle $\mathit{abc}$.

Then the quadrilateral $\mathit{abcz}$ is equal to the quadrilateral
$\mathit{abci}$.
But the quadrilateral $\mathit{abcz}$ is one-half of the quadrilateral $\mathit{abcd}$.
Therefore $\mathit{abci}$ is one-half of the quadrilateral
$\mathit{abcd}$;      \hfill ``ut~oportet.''\qquad\qquad

quadrilateral by a line drawn from a given vertex of the
quadrilateral.''} [Leonardo 40, p.~140, ll.~36--37.]

Let the given fraction be as $\mathit{ez:zi}$, and let the
quadrilateral be $\mathit{abcd}$ and
the given vertex $d$.
Divide $\mathit{ac}$ in $t$ such that
\[
  \mathit{at:tc} = \mathit{ez:zi}.
\]
If $\mathit{bd}$ pass through $t$ [then $\mathit{bd}$ is
the line required].

But if $\mathit{bd}$ do not pass through
$t$ it will intersect either $\mathit{ct}$ or $\mathit{ta}$;
let it intersect $\mathit{ct}$. Join $\mathit{bt}$, $\mathit{td}$.

Then
\[
  \text{quadl.}\mathit{tbcd} : \text{quadl.}\mathit{tbad}=\mathit{ct:ta}=\mathit{ez:zi}.
\]

Draw $\mathit{tl}$ parallel to the diagonal $\mathit{bd}$, and join $\mathit{dl}$.
Then the quadrilaterals $\mathit{lbcd, tbcd}$ are equal and the construction has
been made as required; for
\[
  \mathit{ct:ta}=\mathit{ez:zi} = \text{quadl.}\mathit{lbcd} : \triangle\mathit{dal}.
\]

And if $\mathit{bd}$ intersect $\mathit{ta}$ [a similar construction may be given
to divide the given quadrilateral, by a line through $d$, into a
quadrilateral and triangle in the required ratio].

\SmallLeftNote{Leonardo then gives the construction for dividing a quadrilateral in
a given ratio by a line drawn through a point which divides a side of the
quadrilateral in the given ratio.}

Let $\mathit{abcd}$ be the given quadrilateral, $e$ the given point.
Divide $\mathit{ac}$ into two equal parts by the line $\mathit{dt}$ [Prop.~14].
Join $\mathit{et}$. The line $\mathit{et}$ either is, or is not,
parallel to $\mathit{dc}$.

\SmallCenteredNote{(Two of Leonardo's figures are combined in one, here.)}

If $\mathit{et}$ be parallel to $\mathit{dc}$, join $\mathit{ec}$.
Then the quadrilateral $\mathit{ac}$ [is bisected by the line $\mathit{ec}$, etc.].

If $\mathit{et}$ be not parallel to $\mathit{dc}$,
draw $\mathit{dz} \parallel \mathit{et}$. Join $\mathit{ez}$.
Then $\mathit{ac}$ [is bisected by the line $\mathit{ez}$, etc.].

\SmallLeftNote{
Leonardo does not consider the case of failure of this construction, namely
when $\mathit{dz}$ falls outside the quadrilateral. Suppose in such a case that the
problem were solved by a line joining $e$ to a point $z'$ (not shown in the figure)
on $\mathit{dc}$. Through $t$, draw $\mathit{tt'} \parallel \mathit{cd}$.
Join $\mathit{ct'}$.
Then $\triangle\mathit{ct'd} = \triangle\mathit{ctd}= \triangle\mathit{edz'}$.
Whence $\triangle \mathit{et'c} = \triangle\mathit{ez'c}$,
or $\mathit{t'z'} \parallel \mathit{ce}$.
Therefore from $t'$, $z'$ may be found and the
solution in this case is also possible, indeed in more than one way, but it is
not in Euclid's manner to consider this question.}

Should the diagonal $\mathit{db}$ bisect the quadrilateral $\mathit{ac}$,
the discussion is similar to the above.

But if the line drawn from $d$ to bisect the quadrilateral
meet the side $\mathit{ab}$ in $i$,
draw $\mathit{bk}$ bisecting the quadrilateral $\mathit{ac}$.

If $k$ be not the given point, it will be between $k$ and $d$ or
between $k$ and $a$.
% -----File: 060.png---Folio 48------------------------------------------------------

In the first case join $\mathit{be}$ and through $k$ draw

If the point $e$ be between $a$ and $k$ [a similar construction

  This proposition is interesting as illustrating the method of
  \emph{application of areas} which was
  ``one of the most powerful methods on which Greek Geometry relied.''
  The method first appears in the \textit{Elements} in \textsc{i}.~44:
  \textit{To a given straight line to apply, in a given rectilineal
  angle, a parallelogram equal to a given triangle}---a proposition
  which Heath characterises as
  ``one of the most impressive in all geometry''
  while the ``marvellous ingenuity of the solution is indeed worthy
  of the `godlike men of old' as Proclus calls the discoverers of the
  method of `application of areas'; and there would seem to be no
  reason to doubt that the particular solution, like the whole theory,
  was Pythagorean, and not a new solution due to Euclid himself.''

  The simple \emph{application} of a parallelogram of given area to a
  given straight line as one of its sides is what we have in the
  \textit{Elements} \textsc{i}.~44 and 45; the general form
  of the problem with regard to \emph{exceeding} and
  \emph{falling-short} may be stated thus:

  ``To apply to a given straight line a rectangle
  (or, more generally, a parallelogram)
  equal to a given rectilineal figure and (1) \emph{exceeding}
  or (2) \emph{falling-short} by a square (or, in the more general
  case, a parallelogram similar to a given parallelogram).''

  What is meant by saying that the applied parallelogram
  (1) \emph{exceeds} or (2) \emph{falls short} is that, while its
  base coincides and is coterminous \emph{at one end} with the
  straight line, the said base (1) overlaps or (2) falls short of
  the straight line \emph{at the other end}, and the portion by
  which the applied parallelogram exceeds a parallelogram of the
  same angle and height on the given straight line (exactly) as
  base is a parallelogram similar to a given parallelogram
  (or, in particular cases, a square). In the case where the
  parallelogram is to \emph{fall short}, some such remark
  as Woepcke's (note 104) is necessary to express the condition
  of possibility of solution. For the other case see note 116.

  The solution of the problems here stated is equivalent to the
  solution of a quadratic equation. By means of
  \textsc{ii}.~5 and 6 we can solve the equations
  \begin{align*}
    ax \pm x^2 &= b^2,\\
    x^2 - ax &= b^2,
  \end{align*}
  but in \textsc{vi}.~28,~29 Euclid gives the equivalent of
  the solution of the general equations \[ax \pm px^2 = A. \]
  \textsc{vi}.~28 is:
  \textit{To a given straight line to apply a parallelogram equal
  to a given rectilineal figure and deficient by a parallelogrammic
  figure similar to a given one:
  thus the given rectilineal figure must not be greater than the parallelogram
  described on the half of the straight line and similar to the defect.}

  The Proposition~18 of Euclid under consideration is a particular case
  of this problem and as the fragment of the text and Woepcke's note
  (note~104) are contained in it, doubt may well be entertained as to
  whether Euclid gave any construction in his book \textit{On Divisions}.
  The problem can be solved without the aid of Book \textsc{vi} of the
  \textit{Elements} and by means of \textsc{ii}.~5 and
  \textsc{ii}.~14 only, as indicated in the text above.

  The appropriation of the terms parabola (\emph{application}),
  hyperbola (\emph{exceeding}) and ellipse (\emph{falling-short})
  to conic sections was first introduced by Apollonius as expressing
  in each case the fundamental properties of curves as stated by him.
  This fundamental property is the geometrical equivalent of the
  Cartesian equation referred to any diameter of the conic and the
  tangent at its extremity as (in general, oblique) axes.
  More particulars in this connection are given by Heath.

  The terms ``parabolic,'' ``hyperbolic'' and ``elliptic,''
  introduced by Klein for the three main divisions of Geometry,
  are appropriate to systems in which a straight angle equals,
  exceeds and falls short of the angle sum of any triangle.

Bisect $\mathit{AB}$ in $D$, and if the square on $\mathit{AD}$ be equal to the square on $b$,
the thing required is done. But if it be not equal to it, $\mathit{AD}$ must be greater
than $b$ according to the determination. Then draw $\mathit{DO}$ perpendicular to $\mathit{AB}$
and equal to $b$; produce $\mathit{OD}$ to $N$ so that $\mathit{ON}=\mathit{DB}$
(or $\tfrac{1}{2}a$); and with $O$ as
centre and radius $\mathit{ON}$ describe a circle cutting $\mathit{DB}$ in $Z$.

Then $\mathit{ZB}$ (or $x$) is found, and therefore the required rectangle $\mathit{AH}$.

on $\mathit{DZ}$ is equal to the

It is required to draw through
$D$ a straight line which divides
the triangle $\mathit{ABC}$ into two equal
parts.

parallel to the line $\mathit{BC}$, as $\mathit{DE}$, and\DPnote{yes, starting a new paragraph}

to half of the rectangle $\mathit{AB}\centerdot\mathit{BC}$,
such as
\[

\left[\mathit{TB}=\dfrac{\mathit{AB}\centerdot\mathit{BC}}{2\mathit{DE}}\right].

Let the rectangle applied be
\[

  \mathit{TB}\centerdot\mathit{BE}].
\]

Draw the line $\mathit{HD}$ and produce it to $Z$.

Then this is the line required and the triangle $\mathit{ABC}$ is
divided into two equal parts $\mathit{HBZ}$ and $\mathit{HZCA}$.

\textit{Demonstration}.
The rectangle $\mathit{TB}\centerdot\mathit{BE}$ is equal to the
rectangle $\mathit{TH}\centerdot\mathit{HB}$, whence it follows that
\begin{DPalign*}
  BT: TH &= HB: BE;  \\
  \lintertext{then \textit{dividendo}\footnotemark[108]} TB: BH &= BH: HE. \\
  \lintertext{But} BH: HE &= BZ: ED;   \tag*{[\textsc{vi}.~2]} \\
  \lintertext{therefore}  TB: BH &= BZ: ED.
\end{DPalign*}
Consequently the rectangle $\mathit{TB}\centerdot\mathit{ED}$ is equal
to the rectangle $\mathit{BH}\centerdot\mathit{BZ}$.
But the rectangle $\mathit{TB}\centerdot\mathit{ED}$ is equal to half the
rectangle $\mathit{AB}\centerdot\mathit{BC}$; and
\[\mathit{BH}\centerdot\mathit{BZ:AB}\centerdot\mathit{BC}
= \triangle\mathit{HBZ}: \triangle\mathit{ABC}\footnotemark[88],

% -----File: 066.png---Folio 54------------------------------------------------------
since the angle $B$ is common. The triangle $\mathit{HBZ}$ is, then,
half the triangle $\mathit{ABC}$.

Therefore the triangle $\mathit{ABC}$ is divided into two equal
parts $\mathit{BHZ}$ and $\mathit{AHZC}$.

If, in applying to $\mathit{TB}$ a parallelogram equal to the rectangle
$\mathit{TB}\centerdot\mathit{BE}$ and of which the complement
is a square, we obtain the rectangle
$\mathit{AB}\centerdot\mathit{AT}$\Footnote{109}{                         % Footnote 109
  ``In other words when $H$ coincides with $A$.
  This can only be the case
  when $D$ is situated on the line which joins $A$ to the middle of
  the base $\mathit{BC}$''
  (Woepcke). If $D$ were at the centre of gravity of the triangle,
  three lines could be
  drawn through $D$ dividing the triangle into two equal parts.
  As introductory to his Prop.~3, Leonardo proved that the medians of a
  triangle meet in a point, and trisect one another---results known
  to Archimedes\footnotemark[601],\DPnote{* was 60a}
  but no complete, strictly geometric proof has come down to us from
  the Greeks. Leonardo then proves that if a point be taken on any
  one of the medians, or on one of the medians produced, the line
  through this point and the corresponding angular point of the
  triangle will divide the triangle into two equal parts.
  He next shows that lines through the vertices of a triangle and
  any point within not on one of the medians, will divide the given
  triangle into triangles whose areas are each either greater than or
  less than the area of half of the original triangle.
  This leads Leonardo to the consideration of the problem, to draw
  through a point, within a triangle and not on one of the medians,
  a line which \emph{will} bisect the area of the triangle.
  (Euclid, Prop.~19.)

  The last paragraph of Euclid's proof, as it has come down to us
  through Arabian sources, does not ring true, and it was not in
  the Euclidean manner to consider special cases.

, we may demonstrate in
an analogous manner, by drawing the line $\mathit{AD}$ and prolonging
it to $K$, that the triangle $\mathit{ABK}$ is one-half of the triangle
$\mathit{ABC}$. And this is what was required to be demonstrated.''

  Leonardo gives the details of the proof for the case of one-third
  and does not refer to any other fraction.
  If, however, the ``certain fraction'' were the ratio
  of the lengths of two given lines, $m:n$, we could readily
  construct a rectangle equal to
  $\dfrac{m}{n}\centerdot AB\centerdot BC$, and then find the
  rectangle $\mathit{BZ}\centerdot\mathit{ED}$ equal to it.
  The rest of the construction is the same as given above.

  there will be two, one, or no solutions of Propositions~19 and 20.
  Leonardo considers only the Euclidean cases.

  The case where there is no solution may be readily indicated.

  formed by lines drawn through $D$ to meet $\mathit{AB}$ and $\mathit{BC}$,
  the triangle $\mathit{HBT}$ has the minimum area. (Easily shown synthetically
  as in \textsc{D.~Cresswell},

  Similar minimum triangles may be found in connection with the pairs

  triangles is less than the triangle $\mathit{HBT}$. Then if

  This and the next four auxiliary propositions for which I supply        % a really long footnote
  possible proofs, seem to be neither formally stated nor proved by
  Leonardo.
  At least some of the results are nevertheless assumed in his
  discussion of Euclid's later propositions, as we shall presently see.
  Although these auxiliary propositions are not given in the
  \textit{Elements}, they are assumed as known by Archimedes, Ptolemy
  and Apollonius.

  For example, in Archimedes' ``On Sphere and Cylinder,''
  \textsc{ii}.~9 (Heiberg, ed.~\textsc{i}, 1910, p.~227;
  Heath, ed.\ 1897, p.~90), Woepcke~21 is used.
  See also Eutocius' Commentary (Archimedis \textit{Opera omnia}
  ed.~Heiberg, \textsc{iii}, 1881, p.~257, etc.), and
  \textsc{Heiberg}, \textit{Quaestiones Archimedeae}, Hauniae, 1879,
  p.~45~f.
  For a possible application by Archimedes (in his
  \textit{Measurement of a circle}) of what is practically equivalent
  to Woepcke~24, see Heath's \textit{Archimedes\dots}, 1897, p.~xc.

  The equivalent of Woepcke~24 is assumed in the proof of a proposition
  given by Ptolemy (87--165~A.~D.) in his \textit{Syntaxis},
  vol.~\textsc{i}, Heiberg edition, Leipzig, 1898, pp.~43--44.
  This in turn is tacitly assumed by Aristarchus of Samos (\textit{circa}
  310--230~B.~C.) in his work
  \textit{On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon}
  (see Heath's edition \textit{Aristarchus of Samos the Ancient Copernicus},
  Oxford, 1913, pp.~367, 369, 377, 381, 389, 391).

  As to the use of the auxiliary propositions in the two works
  \textit{Proportional Section} and \textit{On Cutting off a Space},
  of Apollonius, we must refer to Pappus' account
  (Pappi Alexandrini \textit{Collectionis\dots} ed.~Hultsch,
  vol.~\textsc{ii}, 1877, pp.~684 ff.).
  Woepcke~21, 22 occur on pp.~696--697; Woepcke~24 enters on pp.~684--687;
  Woepcke~23, 25 are given on pp.~687, 689. Perhaps this last statement
  should be modified; for whereas Euclid's propositions affirm that if
  \[  a:b \gtrless c:d, \quad a-b:b \gtrless c-d:d, \]
  Pappus shows that if \[ a:b \gtrless c:d, \quad a:a-b \lessgtr c:c-d; \]
  but these propositions are immediately followed by others which state
  that if \[ a:b \gtrless c:d, \text{ then } b:a \lessgtr d:c. \]

  Below is given a list of the various restorations of the above-named
  works of Apollonius, based on the account of Pappus.
  By reference to these restorations the way in which the auxiliary
  propositions are used or avoided may be observed.
  We have already (Art.~21) noticed a connection of Apollonius' work
  \textit{On Cutting off a Space} with our subject under discussion.
  Some of these titles will therefore supplement the list given in the Appendix.

It is really this converse, and not the proposition, which Euclid uses in
Proposition~26. Proclus remarks (page~407) that the converses of Euclid's
Elements, \textsc{i}.~35,~36, about parallelograms, are unnecessary ``because it is easy
to see that the method would be the same, and therefore the reader may
properly be left to prove them for himself.'' No doubt similar comment is
justifiable here.}

  The auxiliary propositions are introduced, apparently, to assist
  in rendering, with faultless logic, the remarkable proof of
  Proposition 26. In this proof it will be observed that we are
  referred back to Proposition 21, to the converse of Proposition 22
  and to Proposition 25 only, although 23 is really the same as 25.
  But no step in the reasoning has led to Proposition 24. If this
  is unnecessary, why has it been introduced?

  To answer this question, let us inspect the auxiliary propositions
  more closely. In a sense Propositions~21 and 22 go together:
  If $ad \gtrless bc$, then $a:b \gtrless c:d$.
  So also for Propositions~23 and 25:
  If $a:b \gtrless c:d$, then $a-b:b \gtrless c-d:d$.
  Proposition~24 is really the converse of 23:
  If $a:b > c:d$, then $a+b:b > c+d:d$.
  Had Euclid given another proposition:
  If $a:b < c:d$ then $a+b:b < c+d:d$,
  we should have had two groups of propositions 21, 22, and 23, 25
  with their converses. Now the converses of 21 and 22 are exceedingly
  evident in both statement and proof. But this can hardly be said
  of the proof of 24, the converse of 23. The converse of 23 having
  been given the formulation of the statement and proof of the
  converse of 25 is obvious and unnecessary to state, according
  to Euclid's ideals (cf.\ Art.~43).
  It might therefore seem that Proposition~24 is merely given to
  complete what is not altogether obvious, in connection with the
  statement of the four propositions 21 and 22, 23 and 25, and their
  converses. In Pappus' discussion some support is given to this view,
  since Propositions 21 and 22 and converses are treated as a single
  proposition; Propositions 23, 25 as another proposition, while the
  converses of 23 and 25 are dealt with separately.

  The more probable explanation is, however, that Propositions 23 and
  24 were given by Euclid because they were necessary for the
  discussion of other cases of Proposition~26 (assuming that the first
  case of Leonardo was that given by Euclid), for it was not his
  manner to consider different cases. Indeed if we take $\mathit{be}$ less than
  $\mathit{ge}$ in the first part of Leonardo's discussion exactly Propositions
  23 and 24 are necessary.}.''                                            % end of footnote 113

Let the triangle be $\mathit{abg}$ and $d$ the point outside.

Join $\mathit{ad}$ and let $\mathit{ad}$ meet $\mathit{bg}$ in $e$.
If $\mathit{be}=\mathit{eg}$, what was required is done.
For the triangles $\mathit{abe, aeg}$ being on equal
bases and of the same altitude are equal in area.

But if $\mathit{be}$ be not equal to $\mathit{eg}$, let it be greater,
and draw through $d$, parallel to $\mathit{bg}$,
a line meeting $\mathit{ab}$ produced in $z$.

Apply a rectangle equal to the rectangle
$\mathit{zb}\centerdot\mathit{bi}$ to the line $\mathit{bi}$,
but exceeding by a square\Footnote{115}{                                  % Footnote 115
  Here again we have an expression with the true Greek ring:
  ``adiungatur quidem recte
  $\centerdot\mathit{bi}\centerdot$
  paralilogramum superhabundans figura tetragona equale superficiei
  $\centerdot\mathit{zb}\centerdot$ in
  $\centerdot\mathit{bi}\centerdot$''};                                   % end footnote 115
that is to $\mathit{bi}$ apply a line such
that when multiplied by itself and by $\mathit{bi}$ the sum will be
equal to the product of $\mathit{zb}$ and $\mathit{bi}$;
let $\mathit{ti}$ be the side of the square\Footnote{116}{                % Footnote 116
  We we have seen that $i$ lies between $b$ and $a$.
  And since it has been shown that
  $\mathit{zb}\centerdot\mathit{bi} < \mathit{ba}\centerdot\mathit{ai}$,
  we now have
  $\mathit{ba}\centerdot\mathit{ai} > \mathit{bt}\centerdot\mathit{ti}$.
  If $\mathit{bt}>\mathit{ba}$, $\mathit{ti}$ is also greater than $\mathit{ai}$,
  and $\mathit{bt}\centerdot\mathit{ti} \nless \mathit{ba}\centerdot\mathit{ai}$.
  Therefore $\mathit{bt}<\mathit{ba}$ and $t$ falls between $b$ and $a$.
  But it also falls between $a$ and $i$ by reason of the construction
  (always possible) which is called for.

  In his book on \textit{Divisions} (\textit{of figures})
  Euclid does not
  formulate the proposition here quoted, possibly because of its
  similarity to Proposition 18 (see note 103).

  If we let the rectangle $\mathit{zb}\centerdot\mathit{bi} = c^2$,
  $\mathit{ti} = x$, and $\mathit{bi} = a$,
  we have to solve geometrically the quadratic equation:
  \[
  ax+x^2=c^2.
  \]

  Heath points out (\textit{Elements}, vol.\ \textsc{i}, pp.~386--387)
  that the solution of a problem theoretically equivalent to the
  solution of a quadratic equation of this kind is presupposed in
  the fragment of Hippocrates' \textit{Quadrature of lunes}
  (5th century~\textsc{b.~c.})\ preserved in a quotation by Simplicius
  (fl.~500~\textsc{a.~d.}) from Eudemus' \textit{History of Geometry}
  (4th century \textsc{b.~c.}). See Simplicius'
  \textit{Comment.\ in Aristot.\ Phys.} ed.\ H.~Diels, Berlin, 1882,
  pp.~61--68; see also \textsc{F.~Rudio},
  \textit{Der Bericht des Simplicius über die Quadratur des
  Antiphon und Hippokrates}, Leipzig, 1907.

  Moreover as Proposition 18 is suggested by the \textit{Elements},
  \textsc{ii}.\ 5, so here this problem is suggested by \textsc{ii}.\ 6:
  \textit{If a straight line be bisected and a straight line be
  added to it in a straight line, the rectangle contained by the
  whole with the added straight line and the added straight line
  together with the square on the half is equal to the square on
  the straight line made up of the half and the added straight line.}



  If $\mathit{AB}$ is the straight line bisected at $C$ and $\mathit{BD}$ is the
  straight line added, then by \textsc{ii}.~6,
\[
  AD\centerdot DB + CB^2 = CD^2.
\]

  In his solution of our problem, Robert Simson proceeds, in effect,
  as follows (\textit{Elements of Euclid}, ninth ed., Edinburgh,
  1793, p.~336): Draw $\mathit{BQ}$ at right angles to $\mathit{AB}$ and equal to $c$.
  Join $\mathit{CQ}$ and describe a circle with centre $C$ and radius $\mathit{CQ}$
  cutting $\mathit{AB}$ produced in $D$.
  Then $\mathit{BD}$ or $x$ is found. For, by \textsc{ii}.~6,
  \begin{flalign*}
   && AD\centerdot DB + CB^2 &= CD^2,&& \\
   &&                        &= CQ^2,&& \\
   &&                        &= CB^2 + BQ^2, &&\\
   && \therefore AD\centerdot DB &= BQ^2,&&\qquad \\
   &\text{whence} & (a+x)x &= c^2&& \\
   &\text{or} & ax+x^2 &= c^2. &&
  \end{flalign*}
  It was not Euclid's manner to consider more than one solution
  in this case.

Draw the straight line $\mathit{tkd}$. Since

Therefore the triangle $\mathit{abg}$ is
divided by a line drawn from the
point $d$, that is, by the line $\mathit{tkd}$, into
two equal parts one of which is
the triangle $\mathit{tbk}$, and the other the quadrilateral $\mathit{tkga}$.

But let the sides $\mathit{ab},\mathit{gb}$ of the triangle be produced to $d$ and $e$
respectively; and let $i$
be the given point in the angle
$\mathit{ebd}$ from which a line is to be
drawn dividing the triangle
$\mathit{abg}$ into two equal parts. Join
$\mathit{ib}$ and produce it to meet $\mathit{ag}$ in
$z$. If $\mathit{az}=\mathit{zg}$, the triangle $\mathit{abg}$
is divided into two equal parts
by the line $\mathit{iz}$. But [if $\mathit{az}>\mathit{zg}$,]
let $\mathit{za}$ produced meet, in the
point $t$, the line drawn through
$i$ parallel to $\mathit{ab}$.

Let $\mathit{abg}$ be the given triangle and $d$ the given point outside.
It is required to cut off from the triangle a certain fraction, say
one-third, by a line drawn
through $d$. Join $\mathit{ad}$, cutting $\mathit{bg}$ in $c$.
If either $\mathit{bc}$ or $\mathit{cg}$ be one-third of $\mathit{bg}$,
then the line $\mathit{ad}$ through the point $d$
cuts off one-third of the triangle $\mathit{abg}$.
But if this be not the case produce $\mathit{ab}$,
$\mathit{ag}$ to meet in $z$ and $e$ respectively
the line drawn through $d$ parallel
to $\mathit{bg}$.

Make
\[
  \text{area } de\centerdot gi

and apply to the line $\mathit{gi}$ a rectangle
equal to the rectangle $\mathit{eg}\centerdot\mathit{gi}$,

In a similar manner any part of a triangle may be cut off
by a straight line drawn from a given point, on a side of the
triangle produced, or within two produced sides.

``For since the two triangles $\mathit{TZA}$ and $\mathit{EZA}$ are constructed

$\mathit{AZB}$, we have $\mathit{TZBA}$ equal to $\mathit{ABZE}$. But this latter figure
was half of the figure $\mathit{ABC}$; consequently the line $\mathit{ZT}$ is
the line sought and $\mathit{BZCA}$ is divided into two equal parts
$\mathit{ABZT, TZC}$, which was to be demonstrated.''

Leonardo's proof is practically word for word as the above. He gives two

$\mathit{DAEC}$ will be equal to the whole figure $\mathit{BAEC}$. But the
figure $\mathit{DAEC}$ is one-third of the circle. Consequently the
figure $\mathit{BAEC}$ is also one-third of the circle. Since $\mathit{EZ}$ is
parallel to $\mathit{CB}$, the arc $\mathit{EC}$ will be equal to the arc $\mathit{BZ}$; but
$\mathit{EC}$ is equal to $\mathit{EA}$, hence $\mathit{EA}$ equals $\mathit{ZB}$. Add to these
equal parts the arc $\mathit{ECB}$; the whole arc $\mathit{AB}$ will equal the

equal to the segment of the circle $\mathit{ECBZ}$. Taking away the
common segment $\mathit{BC}$, there remains the figure $\mathit{EZBC}$ equal
to the figure $\mathit{BAEC}$. But the figure $\mathit{BAEC}$ was one-third
of the circle $\mathit{ABC}$. Then the figure $\mathit{EZBC}$ is one-third of
the circle $\mathit{ABC}$; which was to be demonstrated.

\small\DPnote{continues for 60 lines}
The statement and form of discussion of this proposition are not wholly
satisfactory. For ``a certain fraction'' in the enunciation we should rather
expect ``one-third,'' as in Leonardo; while at the conclusion of the proof might
possibly occur a remark to the effect that a similar construction would apply
when the certain fraction was one-quarter [by means of \textsc{iv}.~6],
one-fifth [\textsc{iv}.~11],
one-sixth [\textsc{iv}.~15], or one-fifteenth [\textsc{iv}.~16],
but is it conceivable that Euclid
added ``or any other definite fraction''? Moreover the lack of definition of
$D$ and certain matters of form seem to further indicate that modification of
the original has taken place in its passage through Arabian channels.

% -----File: 080.png---Folio 68------------------------------------------------------
On the other hand Leonardo presents the proposition as if drawn from
the pure well of Euclid undefiled. Here is his discussion.
(I have substituted $C$ for his $b$, and $B$ for his $g$.)

``And if, by means of two parallel lines, we wish to cut off from a circle
$\mathit{ACB}$, whose centre is $D$, a given part which is one-third, draw the line $\mathit{AC}$,
the side of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle $\mathit{abg}$. Through the
centre $D$ draw $\mathit{DB}$ parallel to this line and join $\mathit{CB}$.
Bisect the arc $\mathit{AC}$ at
$E$ and draw $\mathit{EZ}$ parallel to $\mathit{bg}$.
I say that the figure contained between the lines $\mathit{CB}$ and $\mathit{EZ}$ and
the arcs $\mathit{EC}$ and $\mathit{BZ}$ is one-third part of the circle $\mathit{ACB}$.

``\textit{Proof:} Draw the lines $\mathit{DA}$ and $\mathit{DB}$ and $\mathit{AB}$.

``The triangles $\mathit{BAC}$ and $\mathit{DAC}$ are equal. To each add the portion $\mathit{ABE}$.
Then the figure bounded by the lines $\mathit{BA}$ and $\mathit{BC}$ and the arc $\mathit{AEC}$ is
equal to the sector $\mathit{DAEC}$ which is a third part of the circle $\mathit{ABC}$.

``Therefore the figure bounded by the lines $\mathit{BA}$ and $\mathit{BC}$ and the
arc $\mathit{AEC}$ is a third part of the circle.

``And since the lines $\mathit{CB}$ and $\mathit{EZ}$ are parallel,
the arcs $\mathit{EC}$ and $\mathit{BZ}$ are equal.
But arc $\mathit{EC}$ is equal to arc $\mathit{AE}$. Therefore arc $\mathit{AE}$ is equal to the
arc $\mathit{BZ}$.
To each add the arc $\mathit{EB}$, and then the arc $\mathit{AECB}$ will be equal to
the arc $\mathit{ECBZ}$.

``Hence the portion $\mathit{EZBC}$ of the circle is equal to the portion $\mathit{ABCE}$.
Take away the common part between the line $\mathit{CB}$ and the arc $\mathit{BC}$ and there
remains the figure, bounded by the lines $\mathit{BC}$ and $\mathit{EZ}$ and the arcs $\mathit{CE}$ and
$\mathit{BZ}$, which is the third part of the circle since it is equal to the figure bounded
by the lines $\mathit{BA}$ and $\mathit{BC}$ and the arc $\mathit{AEC}$;
quod oportebat ostendere.''

In his \ItalicGreekSnippet{metrik'a}
(\textsc{iii}.~18) Heron of Alexandria considers the problem:
\textit{To divide the area of a circle into three equal parts by two straight lines}. He
remarks that ``it is clear that the problem is not rational''; nevertheless ``on
account of its practical use'' he proceeds to give an approximate solution.
By discussion similar to that above he finds the figure $\mathit{BCEA}$, formed by
the triangle $\mathit{BCA}$ and the segment $\mathit{CEA}$, to be one-third of the circle.
Neglecting the smaller segment with chord $\mathit{BC}$, we have, that $\mathit{BA}$ cuts off
``approximately'' one-third of the circle. Similarly a second chord from $B$
might be drawn to cut off another third of the circle, and the approximate
solution be completed.

Although Leonardo does not explicitly formulate this problem or the
next, the method to be employed is clearly
indicated in the discussion of Proposition~5 (Art.~26).

Let $\mathit{abg}$ be the triangle which is to be
divided in the given ratio $\mathit{ez:zi}$, by a line
parallel to $\mathit{bg}$. Divide $\mathit{ab}$ in $h$ such that
\[
  \mathit{ah}^2 : \mathit{ab}^2 = \mathit{ez} : \mathit{ei}\footnotemark[92].

Draw $\mathit{hk}\parallel\mathit{bg}$ and meeting $\mathit{ag}$ in $k$. Then
the triangles $\mathit{ahk}$ and $\mathit{abg}$ are similar and

Let $\mathit{abgd}$ be the trapezium which is to be divided in the ratio $\mathit{ez:zi}$

$\mathit{gd}$ through $a$ and $d$ to meet in $t$.

Through $l$, $h$, draw $\mathit{lm}$, $\mathit{hk}$
parallel to $\mathit{bg}$ and $\mathit{ad}$. Then I say
that the quadrilateral $\mathit{ag}$ is divided
in the given ratio, $\mathit{ez:zi}$, by the
line $\mathit{hk}$.

\textit{Proof:} For since the triangles
$\mathit{tlm, tad}$ are similar
\[
  tl^2 : at^2 = \triangle\mathit{tlm} : \triangle\mathit{tad};
\]

\begin{flalign*}
  &\text{but} & tl^2 : at^2 &= zi : ez; && \\

  &\text{or} & ez : ei      &= \triangle\mathit{tad} : (\triangle\mathit{tlm} + \triangle\mathit{tad}).     & \textsc{[v.~16]}&
\end{flalign*}

But by construction
\begin{flalign*}
  && \mathit{ez:ei} &= \mathit{ht}^2 : (\mathit{bt}^2 + \mathit{tl}^2), && \\
  &\text{and} & ht^2 : (bt^2 + tl^2) &=\triangle\mathit{thk} : (\triangle\mathit{tbg} +
    \triangle\mathit{tlm}). & \textsc{[vi.~19]}& \\
  && \therefore \mathit{ez:ei} &= \triangle\mathit{thk} : (\triangle\mathit{tbg} +
      \triangle\mathit{tlm}). &&\\
  &\text{\indent But}&
    \triangle\mathit{thk}&=\triangle\mathit{tad}+\text{quadl.}\mathit{ak}. &&
\end{flalign*}

Similarly
\begin{gather*}
  \triangle\mathit{tbg} + \triangle\mathit{tlm} = \text{quadl.}\mathit{ag} + \triangle\mathit{tad} +
      \triangle\mathit{tlm}.\\
  \therefore ez : ei = (\text{quadl.}\mathit{ak} + \triangle\mathit{tad}) :
    (\text{quadl.}\mathit{ag} + \triangle\mathit{tad} + \triangle\mathit{tlm}).

Hence the quadrilateral $\mathit{ag}$ is divided by the line $\mathit{hk}$,
parallel to the base $\mathit{bg}$, in the given proportion as the
number $\mathit{ln}$ is to the number $\mathit{nm}$. Which was to be done.

Let $\mathit{abcd}$ be the given quadrilateral, and $\mathit{ez:zi}$ the given ratio.
It is required to draw from the
angle $d$ a line to divide the
quadrilateral in the ratio $\mathit{ez:zi}$.

Draw the diagonal $\mathit{ac}$ and
on it find $t$ such that
\[
  \mathit{ct:at}=\mathit{ez:zi}.
\]

Draw the diagonal $\mathit{bd}$. Then
if $\mathit{bd}$ pass through $t$ the quadrilateral
is divided as required,
in the ratio $\mathit{ez:zi}$.

For,

and the quadrilateral $\mathit{ac}$ is divided, by a line drawn from a
given angle, in a given ratio.

But if $\mathit{bd}$ do not pass through $t$, it will cut $\mathit{ca}$ either
between $c$ and $t$ or between $t$ and $a$. Consider first when
$\mathit{bd}$ cuts $\mathit{ct}$. Join $\mathit{bt}$ and $\mathit{td}$. Then,
\[
  \text{quadl.}\mathit{tbcd}:\text{quadl.}\mathit{tbad} = \mathit{ct:ta}=\mathit{ez:zi}.

Draw $\mathit{tk}\parallel\mathit{bd}$ and join $\mathit{dk}$. Then

Although Leonardo does not explicitly formulate this problem, the

(or $\mathit{ab}$) in $l$ and
$\mathit{ab}$ (or $\mathit{bc}$) in $m$.

Then as above $\mathit{dl}$, $\mathit{dm}$ divide the quadrilateral as required.

We may proceed in a similar manner to divide the quadrilateral $\mathit{abcd}$, by
lines drawn from the angular point $d$, into any number of parts in given ratios
to one another.}

\small\DPnote{continues for 92 lines}
This problem, also, is not formulated by Leonardo; but from his discussion
of Euclid's Propositions 16, 17 and of his own 41, the methods of construction
which Euclid might have employed are clearly somewhat as follows.

Let $\mathit{abcd}$ be the given quadrilateral and $g$ the given point.

\CenteredGraphic{85mm}{188}                                               % Graphic in Proposition 36

(1) Let it be required to divide $\mathit{abcd}$ into two parts in the ratio $\mathit{ez:zi}$ by
a line drawn through a point $g$ in the side $\mathit{ad}$.

Draw $\mathit{dl}$ such that
 $\triangle\mathit{cld}:\text{quadl.}\mathit{lbad}=\mathit{ez:zi}$.  \hfill [Prop.~34] \qquad\newline
Join $\mathit{gl}$. If $\mathit{gl}\parallel\mathit{dc}$, join $\mathit{gc}$,
then this line divides the quadrilateral as required.

If $\mathit{gl}$ be not parallel to $\mathit{dc}$ draw $\mathit{dh}\parallel\mathit{gl}$,
and meeting $\mathit{bc}$ in $h$. Join $\mathit{gh}$.
Then $\mathit{gh}$ divides the quadrilateral as required.

If $\mathit{dh}$ fell outside the quadrilateral
draw $\mathit{ll'}\parallel\mathit{cd}$ (not indicated in the figure)
to meet $\mathit{ad}$ in $\mathit{l'}$.
Draw $\mathit{l'z'}\parallel\mathit{gc}$ to meet $\mathit{dc}$ in $\mathit{z'}$.
Then $\mathit{gz'}$ is the line required.

The above reasoning is on the assumption that $\mathit{dl}$ meets $\mathit{bc}$ in $l$. Suppose
now it meet $\mathit{ab}$ in $l$. Join $\mathit{bd}$ and
draw $\mathit{bk}$ such that
\[
\text{quadl.}\mathit{bcdk}:\triangle\mathit{kab}=\mathit{ez:zi}.
\]

\WrappedGraphic{85mm}{288}{}{r}                                           % Graphic in Proposition 36

If $k$ do not coincide with $g$ there
are two cases to consider according
as $k$ is between $g$ and $d$ or between
$g$ and $a$. Consider the former case.

Through $k$ draw $\mathit{km}$ parallel to $\mathit{gb}$
and meeting $\mathit{bc}$ in $m$. Join $\mathit{gm}$. Then
this is the required line dividing the
quadrilateral $\mathit{ac}$ in such a way that
\[
\text{quadl.}\mathit{abmg}:\text{quadl.}\mathit{gmcd}=\mathit{ez:zi}.
\]
% -----File: 089.png---Folio 77------------------------------------------------------

Similarly if $k$ were between $g$ and $a$.

(2) Let it be required to divide $\mathit{abcd}$ into, say, three parts in the ratios
$\mathit{ez:zi:it}$, by lines through any point $g$ in the side $\mathit{ad}$ (first figure).

Draw $\mathit{dl,dm}$ dividing the quadrilateral $\mathit{ac}$ into three parts such that
\begin{equation*}
\triangle\mathit{amd}:\text{quadl.}\mathit{dmbl}:\triangle\mathit{dlc}=\mathit{ez:zi:it}.
\end{equation*}

There are various cases to consider according as $l$ and $m$ are both
on $\mathit{bc}$, both on $\mathit{ab}$, or one on $\mathit{ab}$ and one on $\mathit{bc}$.
The method will be obvious from working
out one case, say the last.

Join $\mathit{gc,gl}$. If $\mathit{gl}$ be parallel to $\mathit{cd}$,
$\mathit{gc}$ cuts off the triangle $\mathit{gdc}$ such that
\begin{flalign*}
  &&  \triangle\mathit{gdc}:\text{quadl.}\mathit{abcg}&=\mathit{it:ei \qquad(=ez+zi)}.
    &\text{ [\textsc{v}.~24]}\qquad&
\end{flalign*}

If $\mathit{gl}$ be not parallel to $\mathit{dc}$,
draw $\mathit{dh}$ parallel to $\mathit{gl}$ and meeting $\mathit{bc}$ in $h$;
then $\mathit{gh}$ divides the quadrilateral in such a way that
\[
  \text{quadl.}\mathit{gdch}: \text{quadl.}\mathit{ghba}=\mathit{it:ei}.
\]

Then apply Proposition 34 to draw from $g$ a line to divide the quadrilateral
$\mathit{abhg}$ in the ratio of $\mathit{ez:zi}$.

Hence from $g$ are drawn two lines which divide the quadrilateral $\mathit{abcd}$
into three parts whose areas are in the ratios of $\mathit{ez:zi:it}$.

The case when $\mathit{dh}$ meets $\mathit{bc}$ produced may be considered as above.

We could proceed in a similar manner if the quadrilateral $\mathit{abcd}$ were to be
divided by lines drawn from $g$, into a greater number of parts in given ratios.

The enunciation of this proposition is a manifest corruption of what Euclid
may have given. Such clauses as those at the beginning and end he would
only have included in the discussion of the construction and proof.

After the enunciation of Proposition 36, Woepcke's translation
of the Arabian MS. concludes as follows:

``End of the treatise. We have confined ourselves to
giving the enunciations without the demonstrations, because
the demonstrations are easy.''

In the earlier pages I have referred to works on Divisions of Figures
written before 1500. Several of these were not published till later; for
example, that of Muhammed Bagdedinus in 1570, of Leonardo Pisano in
1862 and the second edition of Luca Paciuolo's ``Summa''
in 1523\Footnote{119}{                                                    % Footnote 119
  A synopsis of the portion of the work on divisions of figures is
  given on pages 106 and 275--284 of
  \textit{Scritti inediti del P.~D.\ Pietro Cossali\ldots}pubblicati
  da Baldassarre Boncompagni,
  Roma, 1857. \textit{Cf}.\ note 61.}.                                    % end footnote 119
It has been remarked that Fra Luca's treatment of the subject was based
entirely upon that of Leonardo. But, on account of priority in publication,
to Paciuolo undoubtedly belongs the credit of popularizing the problems on
Divisions of Figures.

While few publications treat of the subject in the early part, their number
increases in the latter part, of the sixteenth century. In succeeding centuries
the tale of titles is enormous and no useful purpose would be served by the
publication here of an even approximately complete list. It would seem,
however, as if the subject matter were of sufficient interest to warrant, as
completion of the history of the problems, a selection of such references in
this period, (1) to standard or popular works, (2) to the writings of eminent
scientists like Tartaglia, Huygens, Newton, Kepler and Euler; (3) to special
articles, pamphlets or books which treat parts of the subject; (4) to discussions
of division problems requiring other than Euclidean methods for
their solution.

No account is taken of the extensive literature on the division of the
circumference of a circle, from which corresponding divisions of its area
readily flow. Considerations along this line may be found in:
\textsc{P.~Bachmann},
\textit{Die Lehre von der Kreisteilung und ihre Beziehungen zur Zahlentheorie},
Leipzig, 1872, 12 + 300 pp.; and in \textsc{A.~Mitzscherling},
\textit{Das Problem der Kreisteilung},
Leipzig und Berlin, 1913, 6 + 214 pp.

Except for about a dozen titles, all the books or papers mentioned have
been personally examined. In many cases it will be found that only a single
problem (often Euclid's Propositions 19, 20, 26 or 27) is treated in the place
referred to.

Some titles in note 111 may also be regarded as forming a supplement to
this list.

(which are in the British Museum and Italian Libraries) are known to exist. But they
have been reprinted in:

``5. To bisect, by a straight line, an equilateral, but not equiangular, heptagon.''

``14. Through a point without a triangle to draw a line which will cut off a third.''

On pages 12 and 20 of the \textsc{iii}$^\circ$ Risposta Tartaglia gives the solutions and assigns
due credit to the treatment of problems on the Division of Figures by Luca Paciuolo.

(\textit{Opera Kepleri} ed.~Frisch,
\textsc{iii}, 401).
It is: ``To divide the area of a semicircle in a certain ratio by a straight
line drawn through a given point on the diameter or on the diameter produced.''
(\textit{Cf.}\
\textsc{A.~G.~Kästner}, \textit{Geschichte der Math}.
 \textsc{iv}, 256, Göttingen, 1800;
\textsc{M.~Cantor}, \textit{Vorlesungen}
etc., \textsc{ii}, 708, Leipzig, 1900). Kepler was led to this problem in his
theory of the path of the planets. It has been attacked by many mathematicians,
notably by Wallis, Hermann, Cassini, D.~Gregory, T.~Simpson, Clairaut, Lagrange,

Chapter 22: ``Solutio nonnullorum problematum ad circulum pertinentium.''
Three of the eight problems which Euler here discusses by the method of trial and
error, and tables of circular arcs and logarithmic sines and tangents, are of interest to
us. These are: Problem 2, ``To find the sector of the circle $\mathit{ACB}$ which is divided
by the chord $\mathit{AB}$ into two equal parts, so that the triangle $\mathit{ACB}$ shall be equal to the
segment $\mathit{AEB}$.'' Problem 4, ``Given the semi-circle $\mathit{AEDB}$, to draw from the point
$A$ a chord $\mathit{AD}$ which will divide the semi-circle into two equal parts.'' Problem 5,
``From a point $A$ of the circumference of a circle, to draw two chords $\mathit{AB}$, $\mathit{AC}$ which
shall divide the area of the circle into three equal parts.'' (Heron, \textit{cf.}\ Art.~50.)
Gregory (1840) considers these problems at the close (pp.~186--188) of his Appendix.

Pages 233--4: ``To divide a circle into two equal parts by means of an arc with its
centre, \textit{A}, on the circumference of the given circles.''
This is stated by \textsc{A.~Rebière}
(\textit{Mathématique et Mathématiciens},
2$^e$~éd.,\ Paris, 1893, p.~519) under the form:
``Quelle doit être la longueur de la longe d'un cheval pour qu'en
la fixant au contour d'un pré circulaire l'animal ne puisse
tondre que la moitié du pré?''

The solution of this problem leads to a transcendental equation

\begin{equation*}
\sin x - x \cos x = \frac{\pi}{2},
\end{equation*}

where $x$ is the angle under which the points of section of the circumferences are seen
from \textit{A}. Catalan finds $x = 109^\circ 11' 18''$, correct to within a second of arc.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at
http://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
